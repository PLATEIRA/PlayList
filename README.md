## ðŸ’» About the project

PlayList is a project that uses the Deezer Api to list the most played songs at the moment. The songs are displayed on cards that are arranged on the page containing the album cover, title, singer, durations, button to access the full song on Deezer, play/pause button to listen to the preview of the song and button to add/remove the song in the favorite song list. In the Header of the Home page, there is a search field input that displays the result related to the searched text.
